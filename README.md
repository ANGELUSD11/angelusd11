    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Angel💠, I'm currently 19 years old. I started learning to code on my own at the age of 16, driven by my lifelong passion for technology💻. I'm currently          studying a technical degree in Software Analysis and Development while working on my own projects. Thanks to that, I've learned various technologies along the way.
I consider Python to be my strongest skill🐍—I love the language, which is why I've decided to specialize in it🔍. Right now, I'm exploring different Python libraries📚 like OpenCV for computer vision, as well as tools for data science such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Numpy.
I also run a YouTube channel about Geometry Dash where I occasionally talk about programming and modding. I enjoy sharing knowledge and learning new things by experimenting with my projects.</p>
